Steps to generate swagger API spec yaml file :

1. Run this component (use gradlew.bat if you are using windows):
    ./gradlew bootRun

2. Go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to view the live API playground.

3. Save response of http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs as json, and paste it to http://editor.swagger.io,
    convert it to yaml, to get the openAPI spec of the APIs.

4. Update the yaml with the missing response model if required. Refer https://swagger.io/specification/
    for the API spec schema.
